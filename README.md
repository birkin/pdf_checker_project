# PDF Checker Project

This webapp will serve two purposes.

It will allow Library staff -- and perhaps others in the Brown community -- to upload a PDF and get back a [veraPDF][verapdf_link] accessibility report.

It will also offer an API endpoint for Library services to check the accessibility of a PDF.
